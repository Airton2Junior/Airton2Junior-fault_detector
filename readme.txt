ALL Fault Detector System Failure Detection for Assisted Living Environment

Motivation

Assisted Living Environment (AVA) is essentially a scientific and technological proposal that aims to help maintain the lives and well-being of the elderly or with special needs. In order to do so, a control system is used to integrate and coordinate intelligent devices: bracelets, clothes, beds, rooms, etc., in order to extend the autonomy of individuals in the execution of the simplest daily activities as well as to remotely provide health services and Social assistance. How then can we guarantee, in this context, that the system is not interpreting a wrong situation of the reality of the environment or of the patient himself? Or, how to prevent inappropriate responses or irremediable omissions? Only with the effective fulfillment of qualitative requirements, such as error detection and fault tolerance techniques can such unacceptable circumstances be preserved to preserve the health of the assisted individual. In this tuning fork, the present study aims to raise the context of fault identification in distributed asynchronous systems in order to design, develop and then evaluate the effectiveness of the error detection module in a system for AVA control through the use of technologies (Open hardware / software). The methodology used to evaluate this work will be the Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach. In view of the results, we identified the need to modify an error detector algorithm originally proposed for self-organizing mobile networks (MANETs) in order to make it more appropriate for the system context for Assisted Living Environment.

Purpose

This source code was inspired by works [1] and [2] and aims to implement an error detector module for Assisitited Living Environment.
